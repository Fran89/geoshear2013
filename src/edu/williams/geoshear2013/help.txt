GETTING STARTED

There are three main components to this application: 

1) The Main Window where sets of pebbles are created and deformed.

2) Deformation Plot windows that show Cartesian and Polar plots of the pebble axial ratios (Rf) and the orientation of the pebble long axes (Phi).

3) A Deformation Matrix window that shows the 2x2 matrix representing the linear transformation corresponding to the strain, and, in cases where more than one increment of strain is applied, the incremental and the final strain matrices.

The Main Window menu system is used to get help, save and load files, change the way pebbles are displayed, and open Deformation Plots and the Deformation Matrix windows. There is also a Control Panel (CP) on the left, and a large User Interface (UI) panel on the right. The CP is used to adjust the zoom level and positioning of pebbles in the UI, simulate strain of existing pebbles in the UI, create new pebbles, and load background images for digitizing pebbles. The UI panel shows the pebbles (i.e. ellipses) as they are being deformed, and a strain ellipse to help keep track of strain. Pebbles can be deformed by dragging the cursor in the UI and holding down the SHIFT (simple shear), CONTROL (pure shear), or ALT/OPTION (rotation) keys.

Begin by either loading a set of pebbles (File/Load) or by digitizing new pebbles in Edit Mode (described below). A sample file called “Random_Initial_Pebbles.tab” is included with the program. Deform pebbles by entering precise strain values in the CP options for simple shear, pure shear, or rotation. You can also drag the cursor in the UI while holding down the SHIFT (simple shear), CONTROL (pure shear), or ALT/OPTION (rotation) keys.

The Reset button will undo the strain. The Apply button will ‘lock in’ the strain increment, and another strain increment of strain can be applied. Multiple increments of strain can be inspected in sequence using the forward and backward arrows.

The Rf-Phi Cartesian Plot and the lnRf-2Phi Polar Plot windows show the pebble axial ratios (Rf) and the orientation of the pebble long axes (Phi). What is unique about Geoshear is that the plots change instantly as deformation is applied. These plots can be used to calculate strain using the methods described by Ramsay and Huber (1987) and Elliot (1970). The Rf-Phi Cartesian Plot and the lnRf-2Phi Polar Plot windows include many options under the Control Menu for viewing the pebble data and editing the axes. Pebbles are color coded and correspond to the colors in the UI. Pebbles selected in the UI (must be in Edit Mode to select pebbles) are also highlighted in the plots. Clicking on a point in a plot reveals the Rf and Phi values for that point; shift click hides the value. Reference points corresponding to regular grid of Rf and Phi values can be added to the plots using the Control Menu to illustrate how deformed pebbles are represented on the plots. Clicking the Camera icon in the upper-left of the plots creates a screen shot of the plot in .jpg, .png, or .bmp format.

The Deformation Matrix window shows the 2x2 matrix of the simple shear, pure shear, or rotation transformations. General shear can be simulated by applying multiple increments of these transformations. As each increment of deformation is applied, another 2x2 matrix is added, and the final deformation matrix is calculated. The last deformation increment is highlighted, whereas earlier increments are gray. 

Deformed pebbles and the entire deformation history can be saved (File/Save All Deformations). Alternatively, only the final state of the deformation experiment can be saved (File/Save Last Deformation). This is especially useful for instructors creating exercises for students. Both of these commands will also save a reference link to a visible background image, but not the image itself. Files saved are in a .tab format. They can be opened in Geoshear for further work or opened in a spreadsheet program, such as Excel, for more rigorous statistical analysis.

MAIN MENU

	GeoShear Menu

Help - displays this help information

About - shows the title, version, and license

Quit - exit GeoShear (NOTE: this does NOT ask for confirmation nor does it save on exit!)
            
	File Menu

Save All History - saves the pebble information (position, shape, and orientation) for the original pebble file and each deformation increment, the deformation matrix for each increment, and a reference to any background image in a .tab file.

Load Tab File - loads a .tab file containing pebble information, deformation information, and a reference to a background information. (NOTE: if the background image is not loading properly it may be due to the image file having changed location. Also, when a file is loaded, any previous work in the application is discarded.)

Save Current State - saves only the pebble information corresponding to the current state and a reference to a background image in a .tab file. For example, if four deformation increments were applied, and the Forward/Reverse arrows (see below) are used to return to the second increment, this command save the pebble information for the second increment.

CONTROL PANEL (CP)

The control panel is on the left-hand side of the Main Window, and includes five types of functions. From top to bottom the controls are:

	Display Controls

Zoom Slider -  zooms in and out of background image and pebbles in the UI. The mouse scroll button can also be used to zoom in and out.

Unzoom Button - returns the background image and pebbles to their original view size.

Center in view Button - returns background image and pebbles to original position. Background image and pebbles can be moved by clicking and dragging with cursor. Right-clicking on a point in the UI will shift the background image and pebbles such that the point clicked is centered.

	Deformation Controls

Simple Shear - applies simple shear to pebbles in the UI using either the x- or y-direction as the shear plane. There are three ways to apply the transformation: 1) type in values in the X or Y box and hit enter, 2) click in the X or Y box and use the Up or Down arrows to increase or decrease values, or 3) drag in the UI while holding down the SHIFT key. Click the Apply button to lock in the transformation. Click the Reset button to clear the transformation and return to the previous state.

Pure Shear - applies pure shear to pebble in the UI by extension in the x- or y-direction. There are three ways to apply the transformation: 1) type in values in the X or Y box and hit enter, 2) click in the X or Y box and use the Up or Down arrows to increase or decrease values, or 3) drag in the UI while holding down the CONTROL key. If the Chain Link icon is closed, deformation preserves area and X and Y are reciprocals. If the Chain Link icon is open, values for X and Y are unconstrained and area can change. Click the Apply button to lock in the transformation. Click the Reset button to clear the transformation and return to the previous state.

Rotation - applies a clockwise (negative) or counter-clockwise (positive) rotation. There are three ways to apply the transformation: 1) type in a rotation value as degrees (deg.) or radians (rad.) and hit enter, 2) click in the deg. or rad. box and use the Up or Down arrows to increase or decrease values, or 3) drag in the UI while holding down the ALT/OPT key. Click the Apply button to lock in the transformation. Click the Reset button to clear the transformation and return to the previous state.

Apply - locks in a pending deformation applied through one of the transformations described above.

Remove - only visible after the Apply button has been clicked, this button clears an Applied deformation. It can be used to clear multiple Applied deformations.

Reset - undoes the most recent pending deformation applied through one of the transformations described above, but only before the Apply button is clicked.

	Deformation Increment Controls

Red Matrix and Red Rf and Phi Boxes - only visible if a transformation is pending, these elements show the pending transformation matrix, the axial ratio (Rf) of the strain ellipse, and the orientation of the long axis of the strain ellipse (Phi). After a pending transformation is applied, the matrix turns grey and shows the last transformation.

Left Red-Brown Matrix and Left Rf and Phi Boxes - only visible if a transformation has been applied, these elements show the transformation matrix of all preceding deformations, the axial ratio (Rf) of the strain ellipse, and the orientation of the long axis of the strain ellipse (Phi).

Right Red-Purple Matrix and Right Rf and Phi Boxes - only visible if more than one transformation has been applied, these elements show the transformation matrix if the pending transformation is applied, the axial ratio (Rf) of the strain ellipse, and the orientation of the long axis of the strain ellipse (Phi). These elements disappear once a pending transformation is applied.

Forward and Reverse Arrows - use these arrows to cycle through the deformation increments applied to pebbles. 

	Edit Controls

Edit Mode - click to enter Edit Mode to digitize new pebbles, select pebbles, and delete pebbles. Pebbles can be colored while in edit mode. Background images can be added. Click Edit Mode button again to end Edit Mode. Note that deformation cannot be applied while in Edit Mode.

To create a new pebble, enter Edit Mode, hold down the SHIFT key or use the Caps Lock key, left click with the mouse at one end of the pebble long axis in the UI Window, drag the cursor to the other end of the long axis and hit the space bar, drag the cursor to one side away from the long axis to define the short axis, hit the space bar again.
The last pebble created is selected. To select a different pebble, left-click on its center.
To delete a pebble, select it and hit the delete or backspace button.
To change the color of a pebble, select it, click the Pick Color button, choose and color, click the Apply button.

Pick Color - opens a dialog box for selecting colors for new pebbles. 

Apply - use this button to change the color of selected pebbles after using the Pick Color button.

Background Image - loads a background image that can be used for digitizing pebbles. Once a background image is loaded, it can be made invisible using the Display/Show Background Image option.

Color by Rf - opens a dialog box for coloring pebbles based on axial ratio (Rf) values.

Color by Phi - opens a dialog box for coloring pebbles base on long axis orientation (Phi) values.

Both the Color by Rf and Color by Phi dialog box offers the following options:

Pebble Data Set
Original Pebbles uses the first data pebble data set loaded
Current Pebbles uses the current pebble data set

Bin Configuration
Equal Interval over Full Range divides the full range (-90 to 90 for Phi, 1 to Rfmax for Rf) by a specified number of bins.
Equal Interval over Actual Pebble Range divides the actual range of pebble values into a specified number of bins.
Equal Number of Pebbles/Bin divides the number of pebbles by the number of bins and creates unequally sized bins such that each bin contain the same number of pebbles.

Number of Bins 
Assigns the number of bins from 2 to 12.

Rf-Phi PLOT and lnRf-Phi PLOT WINDOWS

	The unique feature of Geoshear 2.0 is the interactive link between pebble deformation in the UI and the Rf-Phi plots. The Rf-Phi plots change instantly as transformations are applied to a set of pebbles.

Rf-Phi Plot - shows a Cartesian plot with Phi on the vertical axis and Rf on the horizontal axis. 

lnRf-2Phi Plot - shows a Polar plot of lnRf on the radial scale and 2*Phi on the angular scale.

For both plots use the Control Menu to:
Show or Hide Major and Minor contours in Phi and Rf values (grids)
Show or Hide Reference Points or Dense Reference Points in the plot
Show or Hide Selected Pebble Information from the UI
Show or Hide Harmonic and Vector Means of pebbles
Change between Linear and Log Natural Rf Scale
Change between Adaptive and Fixed Rf Scale. The maximum Rf value for the horizontal axis can be entered in the box under the Fixed Rf Scale option.

Left-click on a point in either plot to show the Rf and Phi values for that point.

Use the Camera Icon to create a snapshot of the plot in .jpg, .png, or .bmp format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFORMATION MATRIX WINDOW

The Deformation Matrix window shows the transformation matrices for each increment of deformation applied to a set of pebbles. The top row of matrices shows the numbered individual increments, with earlier increments on the right and later increments on the left. The bottom row shows the cumulative transformation matrices after each increment is applied, with earlier cumulative increments on the right and later cumulative increments on the left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES ON GEOSHEAR .TAB FILES

Geoshear .tab files save information about a set of pebbles including a unique identifier, the x, y coordinates of their centers, lengths of their major and minor axes, the orientation of their long axes, and their color. Each deformation increment is saved as a 2x2 transformation matrix. Only a reference to a Background Image is save, not the image itself. 

The File/Save All History command saves information about the original pebble set and the deformation increments. The File/Save Current State command saves information about the shape and orientation of the pebble set when the save command is executed. For statistical analysis of pebbles, the File/Save Current State command should be used to create a file that can be opened in a spreadsheet program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES ON GEOSHEAR 2.0

Pebbles are grouped in a set and deformation increments are arranged in a series. Pebbles are represented as ellipses and the program tracks the lengths of the major and minor axes, orientation of major axis, x-y coordinate of the center, and color of each ellipse. Each ellipse is stored internally as the product of a diagonal matrix (length of major and minor axes) and an anti-symmetric matrix (orientation of long axis).

Deformation increments are stored as linear transformations by simple shear, pure shear, and rotation. Individual increments are multiplied to compute the cumulative deformation matrix. 

When a transformation is applied to a set of pebbles, the following steps occur: 

The transformation matrix is used to compute the new center of each pebble

The new shape of pebbles is determined by multiplying the deformation matrix by the matrix representation of each pebble

The lengths of the new major and minor axes and the long axis orientation of each pebble is calculated using Singular Value Decomposition (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition; http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-svd).
